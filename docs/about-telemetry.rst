About Telemetry Streaming
=========================

Telemetry Streaming is a way to forward events and statistics from the BIG-IP system to your preferred data consumer and visualization application. You can do all of this by POSTing a single JSON declaration to a declarative REST API endpoint.

Telemetry Streaming uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands.
