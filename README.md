## Introduction

Telemetry Streaming (TS) is an iControl LX Extension delivered as a TMOS-independent RPM file. Installing the TS Extension on BIG-IP enables you to declaratively aggregate, normalize, and forward statistics and events from the BIG-IP to a consumer application by POSTing a single TS JSON declaration to TSâ€™s declarative REST API endpoint.
